Expected result from this dissertation work includes, developing of UVM component for verification environment, integrating design under test with developed environment, creating test cases, development of functional model, complete code coverage and detailed documentation about them all. We also try to achieve higher functional coverage report and foreign language integration in our verification environment. Scripting can be used to execute commands in batch mode. The verification environment can also be reused between low and high-throughput cores as well. Also some design concept can be studied to find new ways of optimizing FPGA implementations.
