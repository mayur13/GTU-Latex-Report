Expected result from this dissertation work includes, developing of UVM component for verification environment, integrating design under test with developed environment, creating test cases, complete code coverage and detailed documentation about them all. We also try to achieve higher functional coverage report in our verification environment. Use of scripting is made to execute commands in batch mode. The verification environment is reused between low and high-throughput cores. This dissertation work on development of UVM based verification environment will try to bridge gap between Academia and Indutry practices.
