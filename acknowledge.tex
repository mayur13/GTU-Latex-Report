I would like to express my deepest appreciation to all those who provided me the possibility to complete this report. A special gratitude I give to our guide \textbf{Mr. Ashish Prabhu}, Sr. Verification Engineer, LSI R\&D India, Pune, whose contribution in stimulating suggestions and encouragement helped me to coordinate my report writing.

And I thank \textbf{Gujarat Technological University, Ahmedabad} and \textbf{CDAC ACTS, Pune} for providing IEEE Xplore subscription.
